# SciCloj landing-page

The main landing page for the SciCloj Clojure data science community, the starting page for discovering the SciCloj community activities and learning about relevant projects.

[Bulma.io CSS library](https://bulma.io/) and [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) are included in the project to assist with the visual design of the landing page.  Bulma styles can be applied to Clojure hiccup-style syntax, `[:h2 {:class "title has-text-centered"} "A Centered title"]`.  See the [practicalli/landing-page app](https://github.com/practicalli/practicalli-landing-page/blob/master/src/practicalli_landing_page/content.cljs) for more examples


## Development

To get an interactive development environment run:

    clojure -M:figwheel:build

This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

## Test project
Run project tests using the command:

    clojure -M:figwheel:test


## Build project
To clean all compiled files:

    rm -rf target/public

To create a production build run:

    rm -rf target/public
    clojure -M:figwheel:minify
